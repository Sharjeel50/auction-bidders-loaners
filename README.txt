I've made this program so it can be run really easily without much hassle.

To run this program open "Leap" and run it, which will bring up a input: "Enter file name:" Where you can enter
the file you would like to test.

All unit tests can be found in "Unit_Test_Auction" which checks the main functionality of the system.
